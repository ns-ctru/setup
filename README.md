# Setting up a new CTRU project directory

This is a short [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script written to take some of the tedium and repetition out of setting up a new directory structure for the statistical analysis of studies conducted at the [Sheffield CTRU](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/dts/ctru).  Aside from reducing the burden of work it also aims to make the structure of projects more consistent by using the same structure across studies.
